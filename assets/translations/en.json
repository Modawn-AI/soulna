You may refuse, but in that case, you will not be able to use the AI image generation service.\nAI images cannot be used for identification purposes (e.g., resident registration cards, driver's licenses, passports).\nUsing someone else's photo to generate AI images may violate Playsona's terms of service. The company guarantees the AI image generation service only when using the user's own photo.\nPlaysona's AI is continuously improving to better learn faces with fewer photos, and some of the generated photos may not be satisfactory. Please make sure to check the above face photo registration guide and upload an appropriate photo.\nAI images are generated based on a single uploaded photo using AI programs, learning the user's facial features, resulting in arbitrary outcomes. Therefore, the company cannot guarantee the quality of the generated photos. Refunds for this reason are not possible.\nFor point products, points are used immediately upon confirming the user's point purchase. Once the photo generation starts, cancellation and withdrawal are not possible according to Article 21 of the Enforcement Decree of the Act on Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce, etc. (\"goods manufactured individually according to the consumer's order\").\nHowever, if the purchased product is different from what was advertised or displayed by the company, or if it is not fulfilled as per the contract, you can cancel and withdraw within 3 months from the purchase date or within 30 days from the date you became aware or could have become aware of it. In such cases, the company must refund the points paid by the user to their account within 5 business days.",
